# imgpile
A pile of images on your website.

If you have more images than pixels, you could let a group of related images share the same space on screen. The images form a 'pile' of images. You can see the image that is on top of the pile (the last one added in the html) rightaway. 

Surround the group of images with a link tag, and put some javascript on that.
Clicking the tag should then fadeout the top image, and move it to the bottom of the pile. And so after one click you will see the next image of the pile. And so on and so on.
